      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In this later Å¿tory, beÅ¿ides many other circumÅ¿tances that may bee noted, I obÅ¿erue vnto you theÅ¿e three: FirÅ¿t, the perÅ¿on raiÅ¿ed to life, <hi>Tabitha,</hi> which by interpretation is called <hi>Dorcas.</hi> Secondly, the inÅ¿trument which God vÅ¿ed in the raiÅ¿ing of her, <hi>viz.</hi> Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> Thirdly, the effect of the miracle, which <hi>v.</hi> 42, is intimated to bee two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, fame brought to the eares, and faith bred in the hearts of many people; <hi>for it was knowne throughout all</hi> Ioppa, <hi>and many beleeued in the Lord.</hi> I will Å¿peake onely of the perÅ¿on raiÅ¿ed, for my text Å¿tretcheth it Å¿elfe no further, concerning whom the Å¿tory records three things, her life, her death, her being raiÅ¿ed againe. Of the third point nothing at all at this time, for it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not within the bounds and limits of my text: only of the two former, her life, and death; whereof you haue a Sermon in print Å¿o intituled, <hi>The Life and Death of</hi> DORCAS; to which I will refer you for many good notes; which, becauÅ¿e there Å¿o ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled, by me Å¿hall be omitted.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> In Å¿peaking of her life I will intreat of two things, firÅ¿t, of her name, <hi>Tabitha,</hi> by interpretation <hi>Dorcas:</hi> and Å¿econdly, of her profeÅ¿Å¿ion; her profeÅ¿Å¿ion in the forme of it, <hi>Å¿hee was a DiÅ¿ciple,</hi> and her profeÅ¿Å¿ion in the fruit of it, <hi>Å¿he was full of good workes and almes which Å¿he did.</hi> In intreating of her death, I will Å¿peake of two things, the fore-runner of her death, which was her Å¿icke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, and the euent of her Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e, which was her death.</p>
            <p>The firÅ¿t thing then to be Å¿poken of is her name, <hi>Tabitha,</hi> and that is <hi>Dorcas,</hi> which names doe Å¿ignifie a Roe or a Bucke, and are both of them deriued from Å¿uch rootes in their Å¿euerall lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, as doe betoken to Å¿ee. I will Å¿ay nothing of that obÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation that might here bee made, how that God knoweth his children by name, as he Å¿aid to <hi>MoÅ¿es, Exod.</hi> 33.17. <hi>Thou haÅ¿t found grace in my Å¿ight, and I know thee by name:</hi> to Å¿hew that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and peculiar knowledge of approbation, whereby God knoweth the elect aboue others; nor any thing of the diÅ¿creet choice that Å¿hould be vÅ¿ed in the naming of children; in which point, as I commend not the nicety of Å¿ome, who like no other names, but Å¿uch as haue their good Å¿ignification in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12430:3"/> Å¿o I much rather condemne their abÅ¿urd folly, who out of wit as they thinke, I am Å¿ure without any dramme of diÅ¿cretion, giue ridiculous and vnÅ¿eemly names to the children they come to be Å¿ureties for. The note I doe gather out of her name, and I will but touch vpon it, is in a word this, as her name was, Å¿o was Å¿he: <hi>Tabitha,</hi> or <hi>Dorcas</hi> was her name, and Å¿he was, and wee ought to bee cleare-Å¿ighted, and with our eyes open, to the things that concerne our Å¿oules health. In things of the world we are Eagles, but beetles and moles in diuine matters: curious inquiÅ¿itors into the liues of other, careleÅ¿Å¿e neglecters of our owne eÅ¿tates, and of what belongs to our ChriÅ¿tian duties; whereas if we would Å¿earch the Scriptures as wee are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, we Å¿hould in them be taught what the obiects are, which God would haue vs chiefly to fixe the eyes of our cares and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauors on. <hi>See that you keepe my Sabbaths, Exod.</hi> 31. <hi>See</hi> (Å¿aid old <hi>Tobit</hi> to his Sonne) <hi>that thou neuer doe that to any man, which thou wouldeÅ¿t not that another Å¿hould doe to thee. Why Å¿eeÅ¿t thou the more in thy brothers eye, and doeÅ¿t not Å¿ee the beame in thine owne eye, Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>See that no man deceiue you; See and take heed how you heare; See that you walke circumÅ¿pectly, not as fooles, but as wiÅ¿e,</hi> EpheÅ¿. 5.15. <hi>See that none recompence euill for euill vnto any man, &amp;c.</hi> 1 TheÅ¿. 5.15. And in many other places of holy Scripture we are taught, that if we wil be true <hi>DorcaÅ¿Å¿es</hi> indeed, we muÅ¿t caÅ¿t our eyes, the eyes of our affections, <hi>not on things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but on the things that are aboue,</hi> ColloÅ¿. 3.2. Therefore did <hi>Dauid</hi> pray vnto God, Å¿aying, <hi>Turne away mine eyes that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold not vanity. But I haue Å¿eene</hi> (Å¿aith <hi>Salomon) and conÅ¿idered all the workes that are done vnder the Sun, and behold, all is vanity and vexation of Å¿pirit,</hi> EccleÅ¿. 1.14.</p>
            <p>The next thing to bee Å¿poken of in the life of this <hi>Dorcas,</hi> is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> her profeÅ¿Å¿ion, which was not in Å¿hew onely, and for formalities Å¿ake; but in deed, and in truth: <hi>She was a DiÅ¿ciple, and full of good workes &amp; almes which Å¿he did.</hi> A diÅ¿ciple in profeÅ¿Å¿io<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, &amp; in practice too, a diÅ¿ciple in confeÅ¿Å¿ion and conuerÅ¿ation too; the one by her faith, and the other by her workes, the one is as the roote, the other as the fruit of ChriÅ¿tian profeÅ¿Å¿ion. They met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in her, and muÅ¿t in all that will be true diÅ¿ciples: <hi>Without faith it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible to pleaÅ¿e God,</hi> Heb. 11.6. and <hi>without holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:12430:4"/> impoÅ¿Å¿ible to Å¿ee God,</hi> Heb. 12.14. Faith without workes is dead, and workes without faith, are Å¿innes, not in the Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance, and becauÅ¿e they are done; but in a maine circumÅ¿tance, becauÅ¿e done without faith.</p>
            <p>Morall honeÅ¿ty, without profeÅ¿Å¿ion of the true faith, is blind, and wanteth an eye to direct it; and profeÅ¿Å¿ion, without practice, on the other Å¿ide, is lame, and wants a foot to cary it in the way to heauen. Therefore Å¿aith Saint <hi>Paul, I beÅ¿eech you that you walke worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called,</hi> EpheÅ¿. 4.1.

            <p>O beloued, when the doctrines and deeds, the words and workes, the profeÅ¿Å¿ion and practice of ChriÅ¿tians, of DiÅ¿ciples, of ProfeÅ¿Å¿ors, Å¿hall not agree together, but be at oddes and at iarre with one another, conÅ¿ider and thinke on it in the feare of God, what aduantage you giue to any the enemies of God and his Truth, of ChriÅ¿t and his Religion, of goodneÅ¿Å¿e and good men, to Å¿peake euill of your God, to lay a blemiÅ¿h on your Religion, to condemne your profeÅ¿Å¿ion, becauÅ¿e they will not eaÅ¿ily bee made to thinke that there can be any good root or foundation there, where they Å¿ee no better fruit, Å¿o bad a building. This holineÅ¿Å¿e of life, (I mean not that alone which the PhiloÅ¿ophers Å¿peake of, and we call it morall honeÅ¿ty, which yet commends vs vnto the world, is good in it Å¿elfe, is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to Å¿aluation,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:12430:4"/> but is not Å¿ufficient) when it is the fruit and effect of a liuely faith in ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, and a right affection to Godward, is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and teÅ¿timony of our vnion with ChriÅ¿t, of our Å¿tate in grace, of our being as we would bee taken for, true diÅ¿ciples in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: a teÅ¿timony I Å¿ay, and a token, not to our owne conÅ¿cien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces only, but to other mens hearts alÅ¿o; wheras to profeÅ¿Å¿e well, and liue ill, or to make a Å¿hift to liue morally ciuill, and not care of what profeÅ¿Å¿ion we be, is to beare falÅ¿e witneÅ¿Å¿e againÅ¿t God, whoÅ¿e Å¿eruants we boaÅ¿t our Å¿elues, and would be taken for, and yet haue not on his liuery: Gods liuery is a good life, and the badge or cognizance thereof, is a right profeÅ¿Å¿ion; this ioyntly is it which Å¿hould, this is it which doth, this is it which will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, when words Å¿hall proue but winde, and Å¿hewes Å¿hall bee but Å¿hadowes, whoÅ¿e Å¿eruants we are in deed. Wee all deÅ¿ire, and are glad to bee accounted good ChriÅ¿tians, honeÅ¿t men, true profeÅ¿Å¿ors, the children of God, faithfull brethren, and the like; but let vs Å¿triue to be what we deÅ¿ire to be accounted; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly names will neuer iuÅ¿tifie godleÅ¿Å¿e men, nay, <hi>pium nomen eÅ¿t reatus impij,</hi> Å¿aith <hi>Saluianus,</hi> wee are but openly mockt and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided, Å¿ecretly accuÅ¿ed and conuicted, when we are honoured with names and titles, whereto our liues and manners are not Å¿utable. Therefore try your Å¿elues, beloued, what meaÅ¿ure of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e is in you, let not the names of honeÅ¿t men, and good ChriÅ¿tians, and Å¿uch other, puffe any of you vp; try and examine your owne hearts, with what loue you heare the word, with what care you are fitted to doe thereafter, what conÅ¿cience you make of Å¿inne, what ioy you conceiue in the workes of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, what griefe you feele when your frailty doth make you to fall; thus try, and Å¿o like or diÅ¿like of your Å¿elues. Certainely a ChriÅ¿tian, though he cannot be <hi>Å¿ine peccato &amp; cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,</hi> without Å¿inne; yet he Å¿hould labour to be <hi>Å¿ine crimine &amp; quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rela,</hi> without being Å¿candalous and offenÅ¿iue.

What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oeuer is commanded in any of thoÅ¿e precepts (faith it Å¿elfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone excepted, which is included in the firÅ¿t Commandement, is comprehended vnder the name and title of good workes: euen as the proper branches of our faith doe Å¿pread themÅ¿elues as far as the Articles of our Creed doe; the Å¿um of that which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tian ought to beleeue to his Å¿oules health.</p>
            <p>Let no man therefore thinke it enough for him to bee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and zealous in performing the Commandements of the firÅ¿t Table, while thoÅ¿e of the Å¿econd Table are neglected by him, if not by his open or actuall tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion of the letter, yet by too ordinary violating the Å¿enÅ¿e of them, in his truely diÅ¿obeying vnder an vntrue pretence of greater obedience, by his pride, and malice, and couetouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, breach of charity, of ChriÅ¿tian, yea of naturall affection, hypocriÅ¿ie, double-dealing, and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneÅ¿Å¿e: (into which crimes many I feare, that thinke well of themÅ¿elues, and would be Å¿o thought of others, do yet run head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long and doe not heed it) nor on the other Å¿ide will it Å¿erue our turnes to abÅ¿taine in Å¿ome good meaÅ¿ure from violating the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Å¿econd Table, (which fear or worldly Å¿hame, or other temporall reÅ¿pects may make vs carefull in) while wee make no conÅ¿cience of the Commandements of the firÅ¿t: perning our Religion with the Weathercockes of the time, diuiding our affections betweene God and <hi>Baal,</hi> allowing <hi>Dagon</hi> a roome as well as the Arke, gracing (as wee thinke) our Å¿peeches with oathes and blaÅ¿phemies, making our Å¿elues Gentiles on Gods Sabbaths for feare of being Iewes. God hath ioyned theÅ¿e two tables together, the firÅ¿t he calls the great Commandement (and we make leaÅ¿t account of it) and of the Å¿econd he Å¿aith, that it is like vnto it, and no man muÅ¿t, (if he wil be a true DiÅ¿ciple) Å¿euer the things which God hath ioyned; they may be diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed in our bookes and learning, they muÅ¿t not bee diuided in our practice and liuing.</p>
            <p>Now, workes are then good, when, firÅ¿t, the ground of them is good, and that is the word of God, the touchÅ¿tone by which we muÅ¿t try, the compaÅ¿Å¿e by which we muÅ¿t direct, the Å¿quare by which we muÅ¿t frame, and the rule whereby we muÅ¿t order all our actions, if wee will bring them within the compaÅ¿Å¿e of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:12430:6"/> religious good workes. Secondly, when the roote of them is good, and that is faith, without which, whatÅ¿oeuer hath the name of a good worke, hath yet as our Church Å¿peakes (art. 13.) Å¿eeing not done as God hath willed, the nature of Å¿in in it; and all Å¿uch things though they appeare Å¿pecious and beautifull in the eies of men, yet are (as S. <hi>AuÅ¿tin</hi> Å¿peakes) but <hi>splendida pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> they are not gold though they do gliÅ¿ter. And thirdly, when the end of them is good, &amp; that is Gods glory: therefore Å¿ayth our Sauiour ChriÅ¿t, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let your light Å¿o Å¿hine before men that they may Å¿ee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in heauen.</hi> And the ApoÅ¿tle, <hi>WhatÅ¿oeuer you doe, do all to the glory of God.</hi> 1 Cor. 10.31. And from good works thus vnderÅ¿tood and thus qualified, none are exempted, all haue their peeces of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, all haue their talents giuen them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. to Å¿ome in one meaÅ¿ure, and to other Å¿ome in another, but to all to imploy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of their MaÅ¿ter, and all to giue an account for their vÅ¿e of them; euery man hath his burthen, and hee muÅ¿t beare it himÅ¿elfe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.5. Works of Å¿upererogation are works of Å¿uperarrogation, and he that wanting righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e himÅ¿elfe hopeth to be Å¿aued by another mans, doth but mock himÅ¿elfe as Pope <hi>Symmachus</hi> did when he Å¿aid, and as the CanoniÅ¿ts doe the Pope in Å¿aying Å¿o too (as it is <hi>diÅ¿t.</hi> 40. <hi>c. non nos.</hi>) that, <hi>In Papa Å¿i deÅ¿int bona acquiÅ¿ita per meritum, &amp;c.</hi> If the Pope haue none or little goodneÅ¿Å¿e of his owne (as it Å¿eemeth by this it may bee in that moÅ¿t holy Father himÅ¿elfe) he Å¿hall haue enough deriued vnto him from his PredeceÅ¿Å¿or; if none in poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion, enough by Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion; if little by purchaÅ¿e, enough by inheritance: no, no, the Saints in heauen though they haue Crownes to weare, yet they haue none to Å¿pare: And, <hi>God Å¿hall reward euery man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his</hi> (not according to anothers) <hi>workes.</hi> Euery man is a tree, and Å¿hould be a good tree, whoÅ¿e root is faith, whoÅ¿e Å¿ap is hope, whoÅ¿e branches, the Å¿euerall branches of Gods Commandements, and <hi>of euery tree</hi> (without exception) <hi>that bringeth not forth good fruit,</hi> it is Å¿aid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.10. <hi>it is cut downe and caÅ¿t into the fire.</hi> And, <hi>vpon euery Å¿oule of man that doth euill, Å¿hall bee tribulation and anguiÅ¿h,</hi> Rom. 2.9. O now, if I would looke about the world for a <hi>Dorcas,</hi> and in the troope of DiÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples too, Å¿hould I not need with the Cynicke PhiloÅ¿opher to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:12430:6"/> light a candle, and yet Å¿hould not find? not many. <hi>The fruits of the spirit are loue, ioy, peace, long Å¿uffering, gentleneÅ¿Å¿e, goodneÅ¿Å¿e, &amp;c.</hi> Gal. 5.22. TheÅ¿e are fruits of faith, theÅ¿e are workes of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿nes. But where are theÅ¿e? And in Å¿tead of theÅ¿e, what are the too common fruits of faith? is your Å¿wearing and blaÅ¿phemy a fruit of faith? is your lying and periury a fruit of faith? and what Å¿ay you to your riot and drunkenneÅ¿Å¿e, to your chambering and wantonneÅ¿Å¿e, to couetouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e and oppreÅ¿Å¿ion, to vÅ¿ury and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion, to Å¿trife and contention, to enuie and malice in one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, and the like to theÅ¿e? If theÅ¿e were the Å¿ignes of ChriÅ¿tian profeÅ¿Å¿ion, if theÅ¿e were the badges of ChriÅ¿ts DiÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, if theÅ¿e were the works that God did looke for, God might come when he would, hee Å¿hould finde theÅ¿e things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t vs, &amp; find vs full of them. O iudge with your Å¿elues (B.) is this the way to make your calling and election Å¿ure? as <hi>S.

No, no, if you will, as all good ChriÅ¿tians ought to doe, Å¿triue to attaine to a certainty of your future bleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e, theÅ¿e things ought not to be Å¿o among you; the workes of darkneÅ¿Å¿e are not the way to heauen, the workes of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e are, though no meritorious cauÅ¿e of our comming thither. <hi>You muÅ¿t giue dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi> Å¿aith the ApoÅ¿tle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all diligence, (for all will be little enough) <hi>to adde to your faith vertue,</hi> (for faith without workes is dead) <hi>to vertue knowledge,</hi> (or elÅ¿e you may doe that which is good, but you Å¿hall not doe it well) <hi>to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge temperance,</hi> (otherwiÅ¿e your knowledge will puffe you vp rather then edifie you) <hi>to temperance patience,</hi> (for as you muÅ¿t doe, Å¿o you Å¿hall Å¿uffer for your wel-doing) <hi>to patience god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> (for you may elÅ¿e giue your bodies to bee burnt in the fire, and it Å¿hall profit you nothing) <hi>to godlineÅ¿Å¿e brotherly kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> (for how can he that loueth not his brother Å¿ay truely that hee loueth God?) and <hi>to brotherly kindneÅ¿Å¿e charity, or loue:</hi> (not onely brotherly kindneÅ¿Å¿e to them that are of the houÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of faith, but charity alÅ¿o towards all men, friends and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as ChriÅ¿t Å¿tretcht out his armes on the CroÅ¿Å¿e to both the malefactors;) the firÅ¿t named of theÅ¿e things is faith, the laÅ¿t is loue, in the middle are other good workes, the Å¿umme of all is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:12430:7"/> that, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Faith working by loue,</hi> if this bee in you, <hi>if theÅ¿e things be in you,</hi> Å¿aith the ApoÅ¿tle, <hi>and abound, they will make you that you Å¿hall neither be barren nor vnfruitfull in the knowledge of our Lord IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t:</hi> neither inwardly barren, nor outwardly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull. And thus much concerning good workes in generall, for which this Matron in my Text is here commended; Å¿he is commended in the next place in particular for her almeÅ¿-deeds, an excellent Å¿pecies and member of thoÅ¿e good workes, to which we are enioyned. We haue precept for it, and example for it, and reaÅ¿ons for it, in the holy Scriptures: <hi>CaÅ¿t thy bread vpon the waters,</hi> Å¿aith the Preacher, <hi>Eccles</hi> 11.1.
